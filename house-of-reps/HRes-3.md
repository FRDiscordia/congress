# House Resolution 3

AN ACT, in Congress assembled, to provide the people with a preference on their exposure to NSFW content ("Public Preference Act")


Two public channels shall be created: one for all members, and one for all members who consent to NSFW discussion. This
channel (named "general-nsfw", or whatever the President may choose) shall be opt-in by the people, and only accessible to
the people who wish the discuss there. No NSFW content may be sent to the regular general channel, and instead must go to
the nsfw general channel.

The President shall have the power to enforce this law by mute, kick, and banning, subject to appeals to the courts.
